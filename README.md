## Hypothesis Space

The hypothesis space is defined as the set of all possible hypothesis functions that map feature vectors to labels. It's represented as:

H = {h : X → Y}

[More details](link-to-hypothesis-space-notes)

## Bayes Classifier

The Bayes classifier is defined as:

h*(x) = argmax[y ∈ Y] P(Y = y | X = x)

It's proven to be the best classifier for the 0-1 loss function.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression models the relationship between input features and output as a linear function. The notes cover the formulation, ideal regressor derivation, and the closed-form solution.

[More details](link-to-linear-regression-notes)

## Generalized Linear Regression

This extends linear regression by projecting data into a higher-dimensional space before performing linear regression, allowing for capture of more complex relationships.

[More details](link-to-generalized-linear-regression-notes)

## Non-parametric Density Estimation

Non-parametric density estimation techniques estimate the probability density function directly from the data without assuming a specific functional form.

[More details](link-to-non-parametric-density-estimation-notes)

## Parzen Window Estimate

Also known as kernel density estimation, this method uses a window function to estimate the probability density function.

## K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)

KNN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. The algorithm and its formulation are explained in detail.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is explained from a Bayesian perspective, including the derivation of the decision boundary.

[More details](link-to-lda-notes)

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The notes cover SVM for both linearly separable and non-linearly separable data, as well as the kernel trick for handling non-linear decision boundaries.

[More details](link-to-svm-notes)

## Neural Networks

The notes provide a mathematical formulation of neural networks and explain the importance of non-linear activation functions.

## Ensemble Learning

An introduction to ensemble learning techniques, which combine multiple models to improve overall performance.

[More details](link-to-ensemble-learning-notes)

## Bagging and Random Forest

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and Random Forest, which is an application of bagging to decision trees, are explained.
